# BalatroClone

Project Description:
This is my current personal project that I am working on when I can find time outside of class. It is my own spin on the "poker-themed roguelike deck-building game" Balatro with an added mythology theme. The project is developed in Android Studio using Java.


Project Implementation Details:
The Game class handles the main logic for the game.
The game class has a Deck object that contains an array list of Card objects.
Each card has a suit, value, modification, and an item.
Jokers persist across each round until sold, and each has a unique ability to influence score, hands, discards, money. or some other aspect of the game.
Consumables are this project's version of Balatro's tarot cards and are single-use. They are primarily used for deck manipulation or to build economy.
